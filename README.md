:[https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-the-internet-of-things-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-iot-right-now/ internet of Things] (IoT) is a system of physical devices around the world that are now connected to the internet, all collecting and sharing data. They use sensors and software to work together to collect or distribute data, helping to make services and operations more efficient. The Internet of Things has flourished rapidly in the past several years, many hospitals have benefited from the instantaneous availability of information that can help with determining certain illnesses within a patient at an astoundingly rapid rate. The Internet of Things can also access databases to aid medical practitioners to connect to patient records, previous test results, and other significant medical information.

:Two great applications of IoT that is used in the medical field today, are EHRs and telemedicine. The Electric Health Record, or [https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/E-Health/EHealthRecords/EHR] for short, are virtual medical records that allow medical practitioners to make their diagnoses quicker, which leads to better patient care. Other than storing and retrieving information, the EHR can also detect system errors that can lead to fatal misdiagnoses. For instance, the EHR can instantaneously calculate if a certain dosage of a prescription drug can be lethal when mixed with other medications.

The next major application the Internet of Things that is used in modern medicine is the use of telemedicine. Telemedicine is the exchange of medical information from one place to another using communication technology. Medical doctors use telemedicine to communicate with other doctors, patients, and hospitals. Telemedicine provides seamless communication through TVs and monitors that enable a smooth integration into digital transformation for faster and more accurate results.
